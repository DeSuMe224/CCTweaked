Hi.

Welcome aboard! This is my ReactorController, originally designed for ATM10. I created it for a server my friends and I were playing on.

This was my first Lua project, so the code isn't exactly optimized—it's more of a playground for me to learn and experiment with Lua. The project includes the code for a P-Controller tailored to a 7x7x12 reinforced reactor, cooled with solid platinum blocks, paired with an advanced computer and a 5x4 advanced monitor array.

Is the Controller perfectly tuned?
Nope! It’s just a setup that worked for me and was simple to use.

Can you provide support?
Honestly, I have no idea. I doubt anyone will even stumble across this project, but who knows?

Why is there a PI-Controller in the code if it’s not used?
I implemented it just in case but never actually needed it.

Installation Instructions (if necessary):
Run the following command:

1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeSuMe224/ExtremeReactors-CCTweakedController/refs/heads/main/Controller.lua? Controller.lua
2. Controller
3. Success!

Additional Notes:
You can use the GetFunctions.lua file to explore the available methods for the reactor. Give it a shot if you’re curious!

Special thanks to Kasra-G—your project was a massive help in getting me started with CC:Tweaked. Your controller looks way cooler than mine, to be honest. Check it out here: https://github.com/Kasra-G/ReactorController/tree/main

Feel free to experiment, optimize, or use this project however you like. :)

Good luck and have fun!
