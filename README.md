Hi.

Welcome aboard, this is my ReactorController, initially for ATM10. I wrote this for the Server my friends and i were playing on. 

This was my first Lua Project, therefore this code isn't optimized or anything. It's more or less my first playground for Lua. This Project contains the code, for an P-Controller for a 7x7x12-reinforced Reactor, cooled with solid platinum blocks, a advanced Computer and a 5x4-advanced Monitor array.

Is the Controller perfectly tuned? No. Its just the setup that fit me most and was easy to use.

Can you give me Support? Idk, tbh i dont think anyone looks in this Project.

Why is there a PI-Controller in the code, but doesnt get used? Because i implemented it, but didnt needed, just in case. 

How to install: (if somehow needed?) 

1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeSuMe224/CCTweaked/refs/heads/main/Controller.lua Controller.lua 
2. Controller
3. Success!

The GetFunctions.lua can be used, to get a overview of the available methods for the Reactor. Try it out, if you want to.

Big thanks to Kasra-G, your project was a big help to get into the whole CC:Tweaked stuff. His Controller looks waaaay cooler tbh.

Feel free to play around, optimize or use it. :)
GlHF!
